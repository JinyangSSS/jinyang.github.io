                <p>Pinepple Inc. is an Malaysia multinational technology company headquartered in Petaing Jaya, Selangor. 
                    Pineapple is the largest technology company by revenue (totaling RM3 million in 2021) and, as of June 2022, 
                    is the local's biggest company by market capitalization, the fourth-largest smartphones vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. 
                    It is one of the Big Four Malaysia information technology companies, alongside Zensite UX Design Agency, Win-Pro Consultancy Pte Ltd and Admiral Digital.
                    Pineapple was founded as Pineapple smartphone Company on January 1, 2021, by Wilson Sim, 
                    Brian Gan and Louis Chan to develop and sell Brian's Pinephone I smartphone. 
                    It was incorporated by Wilson and Gan as Pineapple smartphone, Inc. in 2020 and the company's next smartphone, 
                    the Pinephone Ultra, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced smartphone. 
                    Pineapple went public in 2021 to instant financial success. The company developed smartphone featuring innovative graphical user interfaces.
                    By 2022, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. 
                    Gan stepped back from Pineapple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Wilson resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Pineapple employees with him.</p>
